    ">Let T be a text string of length m and let S be a multiset of n characters. The problem is to find all substrings in T of  length n that are formed by the characters of S. For example, let S = (a, a, b, c} and T = abahgcabah. Then caba is a substring of T formed from the characters of S. Give a solution to this problem that runs in O(m) time. The method should also be able to state, for each position i, the length of  the longest substring in T starting at i that can be formed from S.\n",

    "Start by processing the first n letters in text. For each such letter if it appears as a key in the target dictionary decrease the corresponding value by 1. The goal is to drive all target values to 0. Define __discrepancy__ to be the sum of the absolute values of the values after processing the first window of m letters. Then move the n-length window 1 space to the right, check the letter preceeding the left window side(this letter just moves out of the window) and the letter at the right end of the window(just be coverd by the window) and maintain __target__ and __discrepancy__.\n",

And then find internal nodes on branch $S^r[1..n]$. $N(i)$ is the number of common elements between $S^r[1..n]$ and sub-branch whose length is i. If there is no sub-branch with length i, then $N(i) = 0$\n",

Then choose next node on this branch and calculate the distance $l$ between the two nodes, if there is not an extra node on this branch, make $l$ be the distance from the node to end. Then $L(i) = n-l$, if there is not a node at $n-i+1$, then $L(i) = 0$. For example, we want to calculate $L(8)$ of following string $S=cabdabdab$. Here $S(8) = a, n = 9$, we first look at branch start with $a$, and we find there is a branch of $ab\\$$, which means $L(8)$ is not 0, and we find next node and the distance between the two nodes $l=3$, so $L(8)=n-l=9-3=6$\n",

    "Similar to the calculation of $L(i)$, first start with $S[i]$ branch and see whether there is a branch at $n-i+1$, if no extra branch, set $L'(i)=0$, else find distance between next node or end to this node, but this time we should compare the character preceding the suffix with $S[i-1]$, if they are equal, ignore this node and go to next node, if there is not an extra node, set $L'(i)=0$\n",

    "$SP(i):$ $SP(i)$ is the length of the longest suffix of $S[1..i]$ matching a prefix of $S$. We can first get $Z$ values and then convert them into $SP$ values. \n",
    "\n",
    "$Z$ value is the distance from root to node on the original string, that is to say $Z(n-l-d + 1) = d$, $n$ is the length of original string, l is the number of letters out of the nodes, d is the distance from root to the node. For example, calculate the $Z$ values of string $AAAGCAGTCA$. We can get the suffix tree like below. And we found 2 nodes $L$, $M$ on the original string, and 3 branches out of $L$, 2 branches out of $M$. For node $L$, distance between root $R$ to it is 1, there is one $\\$$ branch out of $L$, which means $l = 0$, so $Z(10 - 0 - 1 + 1) = Z(10) = 1$, the second branch out of $L$ is $GTCA\\$$, so $l = 4$, $Z(10 - 4 -1 + 1) = Z(6) = 1$, the third branch out of $L$ is $GCAGTCA\\$\\$$, so $l = 7$, $Z(10 - 7 - 1 + 1) = Z(3) = 1$, and similarly we can get $Z(2) = 2$. \n",
